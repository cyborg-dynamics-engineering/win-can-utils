# Windows CAN Utils

Windows CAN Utils provides a Windows equivalent of [linux-can/can-utils](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils). It offers command-line tools to interact with CAN devices via USB-to-CAN transceivers.

Currently supported drivers:  
- **canable slcan adapters** (e.g., DSD Tech [SH-C30A](https://www.deshide.com/product-details_SH-C30A.html), [SH-C31A](https://www.deshide.com/product-details_SH-C31A.html))  
- **PEAK-System PCAN adapters** (requires [PCAN-Basic](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Basic.239.0.html?&L=1))  

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install**:  
   - Download the latest `.msi` from [Releases](https://github.com/Cyborg-Dynamics-Engineering/win-can-utils/releases).  
   - Run the installer.  
   - (Optional) For PEAK adapters, install [PCAN-Basic](https://www.peak-system.com/PCAN-Basic.239.0.html?&L=1).  

2. **Connect your adapter**:  
   - For slcan â†’ check the COM port in **Device Manager â†’ Ports (COM & LPT)**.  
   - For PCAN â†’ ensure PEAK drivers are installed.  

3. **Start a CAN server**:  
   ```sh
   canserver slcan COM5 --bitrate 1000000
   ```

4. **Dump CAN frames**:  
   ```sh
   candump COM5
   ```

5. **Send a CAN frame**:  
   ```sh
   cansend COM5 055#00
   ```

Youâ€™re now online with Windows CAN Utils!

### Usage

#### CAN Server
Opens a CAN connection and exposes it as a Windows [pipe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/pipes).  
Check **Device Manager â†’ Ports (COM & LPT)** for available adapters.

```
Usage: canserver <driver> <port> [--bitrate <bitrate>]
Example: canserver slcan COM5 --bitrate 1000000
```

#### CAN Dump
Displays CAN frames in real time.  
```
Usage: candump <port>
Example: candump COM5
```

#### CAN Send
Sends a single CAN frame.  
```
Usage: cansend <port> <ID#DATA>
Example: cansend COM5 055#00
```

> Note: `candump` and `cansend` require a running `canserver`.

### slcan Firmware Installation

Some adapters may not ship with slcan firmware. Flash them with the [CANable updater](https://canable.io/updater/):  

- [SH-C30A firmware](https://canable.io/updater/canable1.html)  
- [SH-C31A firmware](https://canable.io/updater/canable2.html)  

**Steps**:  
1. Disconnect the adapter.  
2. Set the boot switch to **On**.
